# Dashboard-for-data-visualization
This MSc project, developed as part of the Advanced Software Engineering & Big Data Modelling course, is a dynamic application designed to assist data analysts in managing and visualizing their data. Implemented using Python, HTML components, and the Dash-Plotly framework, this application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to ensure a structured and maintainable codebase.

The application supports both administrator and user pages, each accessible through a login system. It allows users to upload data files in Excel and CSV formats. Analysts can preview and explore their datasets through two types of tables: the Data View Table and the Data Statistics Table. To facilitate comprehensive data visualization, the application includes six different types of graphs: Bar, Pie, Scatter, Line, Histogram, and Correlation Matrix charts. Additionally, users can filter raw data based on column values to hone in on specific insights. This tool aims to streamline the process of data analysis, providing both statistical metrics and versatile visualization options to enhance data interpretation and decision-making.

The images below show screenshots of the application in action using Bar chart visualization.
